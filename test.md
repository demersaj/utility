## Introduction

## Foreword

READ THIS MANUAL carefully to learn how to operate and service your machine correctly. Failure to do so could result in personal injury or equipment damage. This manual and safety signs on your machine may also be available in other languages. (See your John Deere dealer to order.)

THIS MANUAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED a permanent part of your machine and should remain with the machine when you sell it.

MEASUREMENTS in this manual are given in both metric and customary U.S. unit equivalents. Use only correct replacement parts and fasteners. Metric and inch fasteners may require a specific metric or inch wrench.

RIGHT-HAND AND LEFT-HAND sides are determined by facing in the direction of forward travel.

WRITE PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (P.I.N.) in the Specification or Identification Numbers section. Accurately record all the numbers to help in tracing the machine should it be stolen. Your dealer also needs these numbers when you order parts. File the identification numbers in a secure place off the machine.

WARRANTY is provided as part of John Deere's support

program for customers who operate and maintain their equipment as described in this manual. The warranty is explained on the warranty certificate or statement which you should have received from your dealer.

This warranty provides you the assurance that John Deere will back its products where defects appear within the warranty period. In some circumstances, John Deere also provides field improvements, often without charge to the customer, even if the product is out of warranty. Should the equipment be abused, or modified to change its performance beyond the original factory specifications, the warranty will become void and field improvements may be denied. Setting fuel delivery above specifications or otherwise overpowering machines will result in such action.

THE TIRE MANUFACTURER'S warranty supplied with your machine may not apply outside the U.S.

If you are not the original owner of this machine, it is in your interest to contact your local John Deere dealer to inform them of this unit's serial number. This will help John Deere notify you of any issues or product improvements.

## Handle Fuel Safely-Avoid Fires

Handle fuel with care: it is highly flammable. Do not refuel the machine while smoking or when near open flame or sparks.

Always stop engine before refueling machine. Fill fuel tank outdoors.

Prevent fires by keeping machine clean of accumulated trash, grease, and debris. Always clean up spilled fuel.

Use only an approved fuel container for transporting flammable liquids.

Never fill fuel container in pickup truck with plastic bed liner. Always place fuel container on ground before refueling. Touch fuel container with fuel dispenser nozzle before removing can lid. Keep fuel dispenser nozzle in contact with fuel container inlet when filling.

Do not store fuel container where there is an open flame,

## Handle Starting Fluid Safely

Starting fluid is highly flammable.

Keep all sparks and flame away when using it. Keep starting fluid away from batteries and cables.

To prevent accidental discharge when storing the pressurized can, keep the cap on the container, and store in a cool, protected location.

Do not incinerate or puncture a starting fluid container.

Do not use starting fluid on an engine equipped with glow plugs or an air intake heater.

## Fire Prevention

To reduce the risk of fire, your tractor should be regularly inspected and cleaned.

- ● Birds and other animals may build nests or bring other flammable materials into the engine compartment or onto the exhaust system. The tractor should be inspected and cleaned prior to the first use each day.
- ● A build up of grass, crop material and other debris may occur during normal operation. This is especially true when operating in very dry conditions or conditions where airborne crop material or crop dust is present. Any such build up must be removed to ensure proper machine function and to reduce the risk of fire. The tractor must be inspected and cleaned periodically throughout the day.
- ● Regular and thorough cleaning of the tractor combined

<!-- image -->

with other routine maintenance procedures listed in the Operator's Manual greatly reduce the risk of fire and the chance of costly downtime.

- ● Do not store fuel container where there is an open flame, spark, or pilot light such as within a water heater or other appliance.
- ● Check fuel lines, tank, cap, and fittings frequently for damage, cracks or leaks. Replace if necessary.

Follow all operational and safety procedures posted on the machine and the Operator's Manual. Be careful of hot engine and exhaust components during inspection and cleaning. Before carrying out any inspection or cleaning, always shut OFF the engine, place the transmission in PARK or set parking brake, and remove the key. Removal of the key will prevent others from starting the tractor during inspection and cleaning.

## In Case of Fire

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION: Avoid personal injury.

Stop machine immediately at the first sign of fire. Fire may be identified by the smell of smoke or sight of flames. Because fire grows and spreads rapidly, get off the machine immediately and move safely away from the fire. Do not return to the machine! The number one priority is safety.

Call the fire department. A portable fire extinguisher can put out a small fire or contain it until the fire department arrives; but portable extinguishers have limitations. Always put the safety of the operator and bystanders first. If attempting to extinguish a fire, keep your back to the wind with an unobstructed escape path so you can move away quickly if the fire cannot be extinguished.

Read the fire extinguisher instructions and become familiar with their location, parts, and operation before a fire starts. Local fire departments or fire equipment distributors may offer fire extinguisher training and recommendations.

If your extinguisher does not have instructions, follow these general guidelines:

## Avoid Static Electricity Risk When Refueling

The removal of sulfur and other compounds in Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuel decreases its conductivity and increases its ability to store a static charge.

Refineries may have treated the fuel with a static dissipating additive. However, there are many factors that can reduce the effectiveness of the additive over time.

Static charges can build up in ULSD fuel while it is flowing through fuel delivery systems. Static electricity discharge when combustible vapors are present could result in a fire or explosion.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the entire system used to refuel your machine (fuel supply tank, transfer pump, transfer hose, nozzle, and others) is properly grounded and bonded. Consult with your fuel or fuel system supplier to ensure that the delivery system is in compliance with fueling standards for proper grounding and bonding practices.

<!-- image -->

TS227-UN-15APR13

- 1. Pull the pin. Hold the extinguisher with the nozzle pointing away from you, and release the locking mechanism.
- 2. Aim low. Point the extinguisher at the base of the fire.
- 3. Squeeze the lever slowly and evenly.
- 4. Sweep the nozzle from side-to-side.

## Keep ROPS Installed Properly

Make certain all parts are reinstalled correctly if the roll-over protective structure (ROPS) is loosened or removed for any reason. Tighten mounting bolts to proper torque.

The protection offered by ROPS will be impaired if ROPS is subjected to structural damage, is involved in an overturn incident, or is in any way altered by welding, bending, drilling, or cutting. A damaged ROPS should be replaced, not reused.

The seat is part of the ROPS safety zone. Replace only with John Deere seat approved for your tractor.

Any alteration of the ROPS must be approved by the manufacturer.

## Use Foldable ROPS and Seat Belt Properly

Avoid crushing injury or death during rollover.

- ● If this machine is equipped with a foldable rollover protective structure (ROPS), keep the ROPS in the fully extended and locked position. USE a seat belt when you operate with a ROPS in the fully extended position.
- -Hold the latch and pull the seat belt across the body.
- -Insert the latch into the buckle. Listen for a click.
- -Tug on the seat belt to make sure that the belt is securely fastened.
- -Snug the seat belt across the hips.
- ● If this machine is operated with the ROPS folded (for example, to enter a low building), drive with extreme caution. DO NOT USE a seat belt with the ROPS folded.
- ● Return the ROPS to the raised, fully extended position

## Stay Clear of Rotating Drivelines

Entanglement in rotating driveline can cause serious injury or death.

Keep tractor master shield and driveline shields in place at all times. Make sure rotating shields turn freely.

Only use power take-off driveshafts with adequate guards and shields.

Wear close fitting clothing. Stop the engine and be sure that PTO driveline is stopped before making adjustments, connections, or cleaning out PTO driven equipment.

Do not install any adapter device between the tractor and the primary implement PTO driveshaft that will allow a 1000 rpm tractor shaft to power a 540 rpm implement at speeds higher than 540 rpm.

Do not install any adapter device that results in a portion of the rotating implement shaft, tractor shaft, or the adapter to be unguarded. The tractor master shield shall overlap the end of the splined shaft and the added adaptor device as outlined in the table.

The angle at which the primary implement PTO driveshaft can be inclined may be reduced depending on the shape and size of the tractor master shield and the shape and size of the guard of the primary implement PTO driveshaft.

Do not raise implements high enough to damage the tractor master shield or guard of primary implement PTO driveshaft. Detach the PTO driveline shaft if it is necessary to increase implement height. (See Attching/Detaching PTO Driveline)

When using Type 3/4 PTO, inclination and turning angles may be reduced depending on type of PTO master shield and coupling rails.

|   PTO Type | Diameter            |   Splines | n ± 5 mm (0.20 in.)   |
|------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------------|
|          1 | 35 mm (1.378 in.)   |         6 | 85 mm (3.35 in.)      |
|          2 | 35 mm (1.378 in.)   |        21 | 85 mm (3.35 in.)      |
|          3 | 45 mm (1.772 in.)   |        20 | 100 mm (4.00 in.)     |
|          4 | 57.5 mm (2.264 in.) |        22 | 100 mm (4.00 in.)     |

## Use Steps and Handholds Correctly

Prevent falls by facing the machine when getting on and off. Maintain 3-point contact with steps, handholds, and handrails.

Use extra care when mud, snow, or moisture present slippery conditions. Keep steps clean and free of grease or oil. Never jump when exiting machine. Never mount or dismount a moving machine.

## Operating the Tractor Safely

- ● Pump brakes when stopping on slippery surfaces.

You can reduce the risk of accidents by following these simple precautions:

- ● Use your tractor only for jobs it was designed to perform, for example, pushing, pulling, towing, actuating, and carrying a variety of interchangeable equipment designed to conduct agricultural work.
- ● Operators must be mentally and physically capable of accessing the operator's station and/or controls, and operating the machine properly and safely.
- ● Never operate machine when distracted, fatigued, or impaired. Proper machine operation requires the operator's full attention and awareness.
- ● This tractor is not intended to be used as a recreational vehicle.
- ● Read this operator's manual before operating the tractor and follow operating and safety instructions in the manual and on the tractor.
- ● Follow operation and ballasting instructions found in the operator's manual for your implements/attachments, such as front loaders.
- ● Follow the instructions outlined in the operator's manual of any mounted or trailed machinery or trailer. Do not operate a combination of tractor-machine or tractortrailer unless all instructions have been followed.
- ● Make sure that everyone is clear of machine, attached equipment, and work area before starting engine or operation.
- ● Stay clear of the three-point linkage and pickup hitch (if equipped) when controlling them.
- ● Keep hands, feet, and clothing away from power-driven parts.

## Driving Concerns

- ● Never get on or off a moving tractor.
- ● Complete any required training prior to operating vehicle.
- ● Keep all children and nonessential personnel off tractors and all equipment.
- ● Never ride on a tractor unless seated on a John Deere approved seat with a seat belt.
- ● Keep all shields/guards in place.
- ● Use appropriate visual and audible signals when operating on public roads.
- ● Move to side of road before stopping.
- ● Reduce speed when turning, applying individual brakes, or operating around hazards on rough ground or steep slopes.
- ● Stability degrades when attached implements are at high position.
- ● Couple brake pedals together for road travel.
- ● Regularly clean fenders and fender valances (mud flaps) if installed. Remove dirt before driving on public roadways.

## Heated and Ventilated Operator's Seat

- ● An overheated seat heater can cause a burn injury or damage to the seat. To reduce the risk of burns, use caution when using the seat heater for extended periods of time, especially if the operator cannot feel temperature change or pain to the skin. Do not place objects on the seat, such as a blanket, cushion, cover, or similar item, which can cause the seat heater to overheat.

## Towing Loads

- ● Be careful when towing and stopping heavy loads. Stopping distance increases with speed and weight of towed loads, and on slopes. Towed loads with or without brakes that are too heavy for the tractor or are towed too fast can cause loss of control.
- ● Consider the total weight of the equipment and its load.
- ● Hitch towed loads only to approved couplings to avoid rearward upset.

## Parking and Leaving the Tractor

- ● Before dismounting, shut off SCVs, disengage PTO, stop engine, lower implements/attachments to ground, place implement/attachment control devices in neutral, and securely engage park mechanism, including the park pawl and park brake. In addition, if the tractor is left unattended, remove key.
- ● Leaving transmission in gear with engine off will NOT prevent the tractor from moving.
- ● Never go near an operating PTO or an operating implement.
- ● Wait for all movement to stop before servicing machinery.

## Common Accidents

## Use a Safety Chain

A safety chain will help control drawn equipment should it accidentally separate from the drawbar.

Using the appropriate adapter parts, attach the chain to the tractor drawbar support or other specified anchor location. Provide only enough slack in the chain to permit turning.

See your John Deere dealer for a chain with a strength rating equal to or greater than the gross weight of the towed machine. Do not use safety chain for towing.

## Transport Towed Equipment at Safe Speeds

Do not exceed the maximum transport speed. This towing unit may be capable of operating at transport speeds that exceed the maximum allowable transport speed for towed implements.

Before transporting a towed implement, determine from signs on the implement or information provided in the implement's operator manual the maximum transport speed. Never transport at speeds that exceed the implement's maximum transport speed. Exceeding the implement's maximum transport speed can result in:

- ● Loss of control of the towing unit/implement combination
- ● Reduced or no ability to stop during braking
- ● Implement tire failure
- ● Damage to the implement structure or its components

Implements shall be equipped with brakes if the maximum fully loaded weight is greater than 1500 kg (3307 lbs) and greater than 1.5 times the weight of the towing unit.

Example:Implementmassis1600kg(3527lbs)and towingunitmassis1600kg(3527lbs),example implementisnotrequiredtohavebrakes.

Implements without brakes: Do not transport at speeds greater than 32 km/h (20 mph).

## Implements with brakes:

- ● If the manufacturer does not specify a maximum transport speed, do not tow at speeds greater than 40 km/h (25 mph).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

TS1686-UN-27SEP06

- ● When transporting at speeds up to 40 km/h (25 mph) the fully loaded implement must weigh less than 4.5 times the towing unit weight.
- ● When transporting at speeds between 40-50 km/h (25 -31 mph) the fully loaded implement must weigh less than 3.0 times the towing unit weight.

When towing a trailer, become familiar with the braking characteristics and ensure the compatibility of the tractor/trailer combination in regard to the deceleration rate.

## Use Caution on Slopes, Uneven Terrain, and Rough Ground

Avoid holes, ditches, and obstructions which cause the tractor to tip, especially on slopes. Avoid sharp uphill turns.

Driving forward out of a ditch, mired condition, or up a steep slope could cause the tractor to tip over rearward. Back out of these situations if possible.

Danger of overturn increases greatly with narrow tread setting, at high speed.

Not all conditions that can cause a tractor to overturn are listed. Be alert for any situation in which stability may be compromised.

Slopes are a major factor related to loss-of-control and tipover accidents, which can result in severe injury or death. Operation on all slopes requires extra caution.

Uneven terrain or rough ground can cause loss-of-control and tip-over accidents, which can result in severe injury or death. Operation on uneven terrain or rough ground requires extra caution.

Never drive near the edge of a gully, drop-off, ditch, steep embankment, or a body of water. The machine could

## Freeing a Mired Machine

Attempting to free a mired machine can involve safety hazards such as the mired tractor tipping rearward, the towing tractor overturning, and the tow chain or tow bar (a cable is not recommended) failing and recoiling from its stretched condition.

Back your tractor out if it gets mired down in mud. Unhitch any towed implements. Dig mud from behind the rear wheels. Place boards behind the wheels to provide a solid base and try to back out slowly. If necessary, dig mud from the front of all wheels and drive slowly ahead.

If necessary to tow with another unit, use a tow bar or a long chain (a cable is not recommended). Inspect the chain for flaws. Make sure all parts of towing devices are of adequate size and strong enough to handle the load.

Always hitch to the drawbar of the towing unit. Do not hitch to the front pushbar attachment point. Before moving, clear the area of people. Apply power smoothly to take up the slack: a sudden pull could snap any towing device causing it to whip or recoil dangerously.

Mechanical front wheel drive (MFWD) enables the powertrain to drive both front and rear axles for improved traction on difficult ground conditions and provides 4-wheel braking. MFWD can be engaged and disengaged on-the-go with light loads and on low traction surfaces.

<!-- image -->

CAUTION: Avoid Injury! Use extra caution when driving on slopes. To increase traction and provide four-wheel braking, engage mechanical front wheel drive (MFWD) when driving on slopes. Be aware that MFWD can improve access to dangerously sloped terrain, thereby increasing the possibility of tipover.

NOTE: It may be necessary to reduce engine load to disengage front wheel drive.

Push MFWD lever (A) forward to engage MFWD. Pull lever rearward to disengage MFWD.

## Tips for Operating MFWD:

- ● Maintain front tire pressure at maximum allowable level to ensure proper tire performance in all field conditions.
- ● Engage MFWD to provide four-wheel braking.
- ● Disengage MFWD when driving machine to or from work site to increase front tire life.

KN52281,1003EBF-19-22AUG12-2/2

To improve braking on sloped, icy, wet, or graveled surfaces, engage the MFWD. Add ballast to the tractor and travel at a reduced speed to avoid skidding and loss of steering control.

IMPORTANT: Avoid Damage! Always disengage MFWD when driving on a paved surface.

Put the transmission levers in neutral to move the machine when the engine is not running.

CAUTION: Avoid injury! Stay clear of rotating drivelines:

- ● Entanglement in the rotating driveline can cause serious injury or death.
- ● Keep hands, feet, and clothing away.
- ● Make sure that all shields are installed and used properly.
- ● Stop the engine and be sure that PTO driveline is stopped before getting near it.

## Check PTO Driveshaft Length

IMPORTANT: Avoid Damage! The PTO driveshaft is a standard length. Certain driveshaft applications cause contact with transmission. Shorten driveshaft length to avoid contact.

## Checking PTO Driveshaft

NOTE: Check PTO driveshaft movement before operating implement.

- b. Check the area where the outer tube shield (A) meets the shield bell (B).
- c. If the outer tube shield does not touch the shield bell, make a mark on the inner tube where the outer tube shield ends.
- 5. Install driveshaft on tractor and adjust the center link to level the implement for operating while in lowered position. (See Operating 3-Point Hitch.)
- 6. Have an observer stand a safe distance from the implement to tell you when the driveshaft is fully shortened.
- 7. Set the tractor at low idle and raise the implement. Stop raising the implement when the outer tube shield reaches the mark on the inner tube, or the outer tube shield touches the shield bell.
- ● If the implement is fully raised and the driveshaft does not reach the fully shortened position, with either the outer tube shield at the mark or touching the bell shield, the driveshaft is ready for operation.
- ● If the driveshaft reaches the fully shortened position before the implement is fully raised, the driveshaft requires shortening.

## Ballasting Machine

<!-- image -->

CAUTION: Avoid Injury! Ballasted machine may become unstable when attachment is raised. Always drive slowly over uneven ground and when turning with raised attachment.

IMPORTANT: Avoid Damage! Do not overload tires. Do not exceed tire maximum inflation pressure or maximum load capacity.

Add weight to machine front end if needed for stability. Heavy pulling and heavy rear mounted implements tend to lift front wheels. Add enough ballast to maintain steering control and prevent tip over. Remove weight when it is no longer needed.

## IMPORTANT: Avoid Damage! Remove ballast from machine when no longer needed.

## Tire Capacities

Use the following charts to determine the tire maximum inflation pressure and load capacity.

Verify maximum tire inflation pressure and maximum load information if embossed into the tire side wall.

## Maximum Inflation Pressures for Rear Tires

| Tire Size        |   Ply | kPa (psi) Loaded   | Maximum Load Capacity kg (lb)   |
|------------------|-------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| 26 x 12.00-12 R4 |     4 | 138 (20)           | 807 (1780)                      |
| 26 x 12.00-12 R3 |     4 | 138 (20)           | 807 (1780)                      |

- * Maximum pressure following tire manufacturer's specifications.
- **Maximum load capacity for single tire.

## Using Optional Rear Cast Iron Wheel Weights

- 1. Mount rear wheels in the wide position for improved stability.

CAUTION: Avoid Injury! Machine component or attachment is heavy. Use a safe lifting device or get an assistant to help lift, install or remove component or attachment.

<!-- image -->

- 2. Fasten weight to each rear wheel using a safe lifting device. A total of three weights per wheel may be used. See your implement operator's manual for installation and number of weights to use.

Rear wheel weights are available from your John Deere Dealer.

## Using Optional Rear Ballast Box

<!-- image -->

CAUTION: Avoid Injury! To improve front loadermachine stability, use of ballast box is recommended. Use ballast as recommended in loader operator's manual.

The rear ballast box is used for carrying ballast on the 3point hitch. Approximate weight of different materials is given in the implement operator's manual.

## Using Liquid Weight in Tires

<!-- image -->

CAUTION: Avoid Injury! Installing liquid ballast requires special equipment and training. Injury may occur from exploding tire. Have the job done by your John Deere dealer or a tire service store.

IMPORTANT: Avoid Damage! Cover rim completely with solution to avoid corrosion, but never more than 90 percent full. More solution would leave too little air space to absorb shocks. Damage to tire could occur.

NOTE: Use of alcohol as ballast is not recommended. Calcium chloride solution is heavier and more economical.

A solution of water and calcium chloride provides safe economical ballast, and will prevent freezing. If used properly, it will not damage tires, tubes, or rims.

A mixture of 0.4 kg of calcium chloride per liter of water (3.5 lb/gal), will not freeze solid above -45° C (-50° F).

Fill tubeless tires at least to valve stem level (minimum 75% full). Less solution would expose part of rim, possibly causing corrosion.

Tube-type tires may be filled to any level below 90%.

## Service Miscellaneous

## Using Proper Fuel (Diesel)

Use the proper diesel fuel to help prevent decreased engine performance and increased exhaust emissions. Failure to follow the fuel requirements listed below can void your engine warranty.

Consult your local fuel distributor for properties of the diesel fuel in your area.

In general, diesel fuels are blended to satisfy the low temperature requirements of the geographical area in which they are marketed.

Diesel fuels specified to EN 590 or ASTM D975 are recommended.

## Required fuel properties

In all cases, the fuel shall meet the following properties:

Cetane number of 45 minimum. Cetane number greater than 50 is preferred, especially when temperatures are below -20°C (-4°F) or elevations above 1500 m (5000 ft).

Cold Filter Plugging Point (CFPP) should be at least 5°C (9°F) below the expected lowest temperature or Cloud Point below the lowest ambient temperature.

Fuel lubricity should pass a maximum scar diameter of 0.45 mm as measured by ASTM D6079 or ISO 12156-1.

IMPORTANT: Avoid damage! Improper fuel additive usage may cause damage on fuel injection equipment of diesel engines.

If a fuel of low or unknown lubricity is used, addition of John Deere PREMIUM DIESEL FUEL CONDITIONER at the specified concentration is recommended.

## Sulfur content

- ● Diesel fuel quality and fuel sulfur content must comply with all existing emissions regulations for the area in which the engine operates.
- ● Use only ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel with a maximum of 0.0015% (15mg/kg) sulfur content.

## IMPORTANT: Avoid injury! Do not mix diesel engine oil or any other type of lubricating oil with diesel fuel.

## Using Bio-Diesel Fuel

Bio-diesel fuels may be used only if the bio-diesel fuel properties meet the latest edition of ASTM D6751, ASTM D7467, EN14214, or equivalent specification.

The current maximum allowable bio-diesel concentration is a 5% blend (also known as B5) in petroleum diesel fuel.

Concentrations up to B20 may be used if machine is modified with genuine John Deere B20 kit. Use of B6-B20 fuel will require maintenance interval changes from some components, and special procedures for fuel handling and machine storage.

To learn of any changes to the recommendations for biodiesel usage with your diesel engine, ask your John Deere dealer or reference the Services and Support link on the John Deere Commercial and Consumer Equipment website.

## Handling and Storing Diesel Fuel

<!-- image -->

CAUTION: Avoid injury! Handle fuel carefully. Do not fill the fuel tank when engine is running.

Do not smoke while you fill the fuel tank or service the fuel system.

IMPORTANT: Avoid damage! Do not use galvanized containers-diesel fuel stored in galvanized containers reacts with zinc coating in the container to form zinc flakes. If fuel contains water, a zinc gel will also form. The gel and flakes will quickly plug fuel filters and damage fuel injectors and fuel pumps.

- ● Fill the fuel tank at the end of each day's operation to prevent water condensation and freezing during cold weather.
- ● When fuel is stored for an extended period or if there is a slow turnover of fuel, add a fuel conditioner to stabilize the fuel and to prevent water condensation. Contact your fuel supplier for recommendations.

## Store Safety

<!-- image -->

CAUTION: Avoid injury! Fuel vapors are explosive and flammable. Engine exhaust contain carbon monoxide and cause serious illness or death:

- ● Run the engine only long enough to move the machine to or from storage.

## Prepare Machine for Storage

- 1. Repair any worn or damaged parts. Replace parts if necessary. Tighten loose hardware.
- 2. To prevent rust, repair scratched or chipped metal surfaces.
- 3. Wash the machine and apply wax to metal and plastic surfaces.

## Prepare Fuel and Engine For Storage

## Fuel:

If you have been using Stabilized Fuel, add stabilized fuel to tank until the tank is full.

NOTE: Filling the fuel tank reduces the amount of air in the fuel tank and helps reduce deterioration of fuel.

If you are not using Stabilized Fuel:

- 1. Park machine safely in a well-ventilated area.
- NOTE: Try to anticipate the last time the machine will be used for the season so very little fuel is left in the fuel tank.
- 2. Turn on engine and allow to run until it runs out of fuel.
- 3. Turn key to OFF position.
- IMPORTANT: Avoid damage! Stale fuel can produce varnish and plug carburetor or injector components and affect engine performance.
- ● Add fuel conditioner or stabilizer to fresh fuel before filling tank.
- 4. Mix fresh fuel and fuel stabilizer in separate container. Follow stabilizer instructions for mixing.
- 5. Fill fuel tank with stabilized fuel.

## Remove Machine from Storage

- 1. Check tire pressure.
- 2. Check engine oil level.
- 3. Charge battery if necessary.
- 4. Install battery.

- ● Do not store vehicle with fuel in the tank inside a building where fumes may reach an open flame or spark.
- ● Allow the engine to cool before storing the machine in any enclosure.

KN52281,1003F62-19-29NOV16-1/1

- 4. To dry belts and pulleys, run machine for five minutes.
- 5. To prevent rust, apply a light coat of engine oil to pivot and wear points.
- 6. Lubricate grease points.
- 7. Check tire pressure.

KN52281,1003F63-19-15JAN19-1/1

- 6. Run engine for a few minutes to allow fuel mixture to circulate through fuel system.
- 7. Turn key to OFF position

## Engine:

Engine storage procedure should be used when vehicle is not to be used for longer than 60 days.

- 1. Change engine oil and filter while engine is warm.
- 2. Service air filter if necessary.
- 3. Clean debris from engine air intake screen.
- 4. Clean the engine and engine compartment.
- 5. Remove battery.

## John Deere, Federal And California Emission Control System Warranty (Non-Road Diesel)

## Your Warranty Rights and Obligations

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and John Deere are pleased to explain the emission control system warranty on your 1995 and later non-road diesel equipment engine. In California, 1995 and later non-road diesel equipment engines must be designed, built and equipped to meet the State's stringent anti-smog standards. In other states, 1997 and later model year equipment engines must be designed, built and equipped to meet the U.S. EPA regulations for non-road diesel engines. John Deere must warrant the emission control system on your non-road diesel equipment engine for the periods of time listed below provided there has been no abuse, neglect or improper maintenance of your non-road diesel equipment engine.

Your emission control system may include parts such as the fuel-injection system and the air induction system. Also included may be connectors and other emission related assemblies.

Where a warrantable condition exists, John Deere will repair your non-road diesel equipment engine at no cost to you including diagnosis, parts and labor.

## John Deere Emission Control System Warranty Coverage (Machines with Gross Engine Rating below 25 hp / 19 kW)

In California, 1995 and later non-road diesel equipment engine emissions control-related parts are warranted by John Deere for two years or 1500 hours of operation, whichever occurs first. In other states, 1997 and later nonroad diesel equipment engine emissions control-related parts are warranted by John Deere for two years or 1500 hours of operation, whichever occurs first. If any emission related part on your engine is defective, the part will be repaired or replaced by John Deere.

## John Deere Emission Control System Warranty Coverage (Machines with Gross Engine Rating of 25 hp / 19 kW and Up)

In California, 1995 and later non-road diesel equipment engine emissions control-related parts are warranted by John Deere for five years or 3000 hours of operation, whichever occurs first. In other states, 1997 and later nonroad diesel equipment engine emissions control-related parts are warranted by John Deere for five years or 3000 hours of operation, whichever occurs first. If any emission related part on your engine is defective, the part will be repaired or replaced by John Deere.

## Owner's Warranty Responsibilities

As the non-road diesel equipment engine owner, you are responsible for the performance of the required maintenance listed in your owner's manual. John Deere recommends that you retain all receipts covering

maintenance on your non-road diesel equipment engine, but John Deere cannot deny warranty solely for lack of receipts or for your failure to ensure all scheduled maintenance is performed.

As the non-road diesel equipment engine owner, you should however be aware that John Deere may deny you warranty coverage if your non-road diesel equipment engine or a part has failed due to abuse, neglect, improper maintenance or unapproved modifications.

You are responsible for presenting your non-road diesel equipment engine to an authorized John Deere Turf & Utility Retailer as soon as a problem exists. The warranty repairs should be completed in a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days.

If you have any questions regarding your warranty rights and responsibilities, you should contact your John Deere Turf & Utility Retailer, or the John Deere Customer Contact Center, 1-800-537-8233, or e-mail John Deere from www. Deere.com.

## Length of Warranty Coverage

John Deere warrants to the initial owner and each subsequent purchaser that the non-road diesel equipment engine is:

- ● Designed, built and equipped so as to conform with all applicable regulations adopted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for 1995 and later equipment engines, and all applicable regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for 1997 and later equipment engines; and
- ● Machines with Gross Engine Rating below 25 hp / 19 kW - Free from defects in materials and workmanship which can cause the failure of an emission warranted part for a period of two years or 1500 hours of operation, whichever occurs first, after the engine is delivered to the initial retail purchaser. John Deere is liable for damages to other engine components caused by the failure of a warranted part during the warranty period. If any emission related part on your engine is defective, the part will be repaired or replaced by John Deere.
- ● Machines with Gross Engine Rating of 25 hp / 19 kW and Up - Free from defects in materials and workmanship which can cause the failure of an emission warranted part for a period of five years or 3000 hours of operation, whichever occurs first, after the engine is delivered to the initial retail purchaser. John Deere is liable for damages to other engine components caused by the failure of a warranted part during the warranty period. If any emission related part on your engine is defective, the part will be repaired or replaced by John Deere.

## LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND PURCHASER'S REMEDIES

To the extent permitted by law, neither John Deere nor any company affiliated with it makes any warranties, representations, or promises as to the quality, performance or freedom from defect of the products covered by this warranty. IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, SHALL BE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE APPLICABLE ADJUSTMENT PERIOD SET FORTH HERE.

IN NO EVENT WILL THE DEALER, JOHN DEERE OR ANY COMPANY AFFILIATED WITH JOHN DEERE BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

So these limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.) This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have some rights which vary from state to state.

## NO DEALER WARRANTY

The selling dealer makes no warranty of it's own and the dealer has no authority to make any representation or promise on behalf of John Deere, or to modify the terms or limitations of this warranty in any way.

## John Deere Quality Statement

## John Deere Quality

John Deere equipment is more than just a purchase, it's an investment in quality. That quality goes beyond our equipment to your John Deere dealer's parts and service support. This support is needed to keep you a satisfied customer.

That's why John Deere has initiated a process to handle your questions or problems, should they arise. The following three steps will help guide you through the process.

## Step 1

Refer to your operator's manual

- A. It has many illustrations and detailed information on the safe and proper operation of your equipment.
- C. It gives ordering information for parts catalogs, service and technical manuals.
- B. It gives troubleshooting procedures, and specification information.
- D. If your questions are not answered in the operator's manual, then go to Step 2.

## Step 2

## Contact your dealer

- A. Your John Deere dealer has the responsibility, authority, and ability to answer questions, resolve problems, and fulfill your parts and service needs.
- B. First, discuss your questions or problems with your dealer's trained parts and service staff.
- D. If your questions or problems are not resolved by the dealer, then go to Step 3.

## Step 3

## Contact John Deere

A. Your John Deere dealer is the most efficient source in addressing any concern, but if you are not able to resolve your problem after checking your operator's manual and contacting your dealer, contact John Deere for assistance.

B. For prompt, effective service, please have the following ready before you call:

The name of the dealer with whom you've been working.

Your equipment model number.

Number of hours on machine (if applicable).

If the problem is with an attachment, your attachment identification number.
