Foreword

READ THIS MANUAL carefully to learn how to operate and service your machine correctly. Failure to do so could result in personal injury or equipment damage. This manual and safety signs on your machine may also be available in other languages. (See your John Deere dealer to order.)

program for customers who operate and maintain their equipment as described in this manual. The warranty is explained on the warranty certificate or statement which you should have received from your dealer.

THIS MANUAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED a permanent part of your machine and should remain with the machine when you sell it.

MEASUREMENTS in this manual are given in both metric and customary U.S. unit equivalents. Use only correct replacement parts and fasteners. Metric and inch fasteners may require a specific metric or inch wrench.

This warranty provides you the assurance that John Deere will back its products where defects appear within the warranty period. In some circumstances, John Deere also provides field improvements, often without charge to the customer, even if the product is out of warranty. Should the equipment be abused, or modified to change its performance beyond the original factory specifications, the warranty will become void and field improvements may be denied. Setting fuel delivery above specifications or otherwise overpowering machines will result in such action.

RIGHT-HAND AND LEFT-HAND sides are determined by facing in the direction of forward travel.

WRITE PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (P.I.N.) in the Specification or Identification Numbers section. Accurately record all the numbers to help in tracing the machine should it be stolen. Your dealer also needs these numbers when you order parts. File the identification numbers in a secure place off the machine.

THE TIRE MANUFACTURER'S warranty supplied with your machine may not apply outside the U.S.

If you are not the original owner of this machine, it is in your interest to contact your local John Deere dealer to inform them of this unit's serial number. This will help John Deere notify you of any issues or product improvements.

Handle Fuel Safely—Avoid Fires

Handle fuel with care: it is highly flammable. Do not refuel the machine while smoking or when near open flame or sparks.

Always stop engine before refueling machine. Fill fuel tank outdoors.

Prevent fires by keeping machine clean of accumulated trash, grease, and debris. Always clean up spilled fuel.

Use only an approved fuel container for transporting flammable liquids.

Never fill fuel container in pickup truck with plastic bed liner. Always place fuel container on ground before refueling. Touch fuel container with fuel dispenser nozzle before removing can lid. Keep fuel dispenser nozzle in contact with fuel container inlet when filling.

Do not store fuel container where there is an open flame,

Handle Starting Fluid Safely

Starting fluid is highly flammable.

Keep all sparks and flame away when using it. Keep starting fluid away from batteries and cables.

To prevent accidental discharge when storing the pressurized can, keep the cap on the container, and store in a cool, protected location.

Do not incinerate or puncture a starting fluid container.

Do not use starting fluid on an engine equipped with glow plugs or an air intake heater.

Fire Prevention

To reduce the risk of fire, your tractor should be regularly inspected and cleaned.

● Birds and other animals may build nests or bring other flammable materials into the engine compartment or onto the exhaust system. The tractor should be inspected and cleaned prior to the first use each day.

● A build up of grass, crop material and other debris may occur during normal operation. This is especially true when operating in very dry conditions or conditions where airborne crop material or crop dust is present. Any such build up must be removed to ensure proper machine function and to reduce the risk of fire. The tractor must be inspected and cleaned periodically throughout the day.

● Regular and thorough cleaning of the tractor combined

In Case of Fire

CAUTION: Avoid personal injury.

A

Stop machine immediately at the first sign of fire. Fire may be identified by the smell of smoke or sight of flames. Because fire grows and spreads rapidly, get off the machine immediately and move safely away from the fire. Do not return to the machine! The number one priority is safety.

Call the fire department. A portable fire extinguisher can put out a small fire or contain it until the fire department arrives; but portable extinguishers have limitations. Always put the safety of the operator and bystanders first. If attempting to extinguish a fire, keep your back to the wind with an unobstructed escape path so you can move away quickly if the fire cannot be extinguished.

Read the fire extinguisher instructions and become familiar with their location, parts, and operation before a fire starts. Local fire departments or fire equipment distributors may offer fire extinguisher training and recommendations.

If your extinguisher does not have instructions, follow these general guidelines:

Avoid Static Electricity Risk When Refueling

The removal of sulfur and other compounds in Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuel decreases its conductivity and increases its ability to store a static charge.

Refineries may have treated the fuel with a static dissipating additive. However, there are many factors that can reduce the effectiveness of the additive over time.

Static charges can build up in ULSD fuel while it is flowing through fuel delivery systems. Static electricity discharge when combustible vapors are present could result in a fire or explosion.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the entire system used to refuel your machine (fuel supply tank, transfer pump, transfer hose, nozzle, and others) is properly grounded and bonded. Consult with your fuel or fuel system supplier to ensure that the delivery system is in compliance with fueling standards for proper grounding and bonding practices.

Stay Clear of Rotating Drivelines

Entanglement in rotating driveline can cause serious injury or death.

Keep tractor master shield and driveline shields in place at all times. Make sure rotating shields turn freely.

Only use power take-off driveshafts with adequate guards and shields.

Wear close fitting clothing. Stop the engine and be sure that PTO driveline is stopped before making adjustments, connections, or cleaning out PTO driven equipment.

Do not install any adapter device between the tractor and the primary implement PTO driveshaft that will allow a 1000 rpm tractor shaft to power a 540 rpm implement at speeds higher than 540 rpm.

Do not install any adapter device that results in a portion of the rotating implement shaft, tractor shaft, or the adapter to be unguarded. The tractor master shield shall overlap the end of the splined shaft and the added adaptor device as outlined in the table.

The angle at which the primary implement PTO driveshaft can be inclined may be reduced depending on the shape and size of the tractor master shield and the shape and size of the guard of the primary implement PTO driveshaft.

Do not raise implements high enough to damage the tractor master shield or guard of primary implement PTO driveshaft. Detach the PTO driveline shaft if it is necessary to increase implement height. (See Attching/Detaching PTO Driveline)

When using Type 3/4 PTO, inclination and turning angles may be reduced depending on type of PTO master shield and coupling rails.

Operating the Tractor Safely

You can reduce the risk of accidents by following these simple precautions:

● Use your tractor only for jobs it was designed to perform, for example, pushing, pulling, towing, actuating, and carrying a variety of interchangeable equipment designed to conduct agricultural work.

● Operators must be mentally and physically capable of accessing the operator’s station and/or controls, and operating the machine properly and safely.

● Never operate machine when distracted, fatigued, or impaired. Proper machine operation requires the operator’s full attention and awareness.

● This tractor is not intended to be used as a recreational vehicle.

● Read this operator’s manual before operating the tractor and follow operating and safety instructions in the manual and on the tractor.

● Follow operation and ballasting instructions found in the operator’s manual for your implements/attachments, such as front loaders.

● Follow the instructions outlined in the operator’s manual of any mounted or trailed machinery or trailer. Do not operate a combination of tractor-machine or tractor- trailer unless all instructions have been followed.

● Make sure that everyone is clear of machine, attached equipment, and work area before starting engine or operation.

● Stay clear of the three-point linkage and pickup hitch (if equipped) when controlling them.

● Keep hands, feet, and clothing away from power-driven parts.

Driving Concerns

● Never get on or off a moving tractor.

● Complete any required training prior to operating vehicle.

● Keep all children and nonessential personnel off tractors and all equipment.

● Never ride on a tractor unless seated on a John Deere approved seat with a seat belt.

● Keep all shields/guards in place.

● Use appropriate visual and audible signals when operating on public roads.

● Move to side of road before stopping.

● Reduce speed when turning, applying individual brakes, or operating around hazards on rough ground or steep slopes.

● Stability degrades when attached implements are at high position.

● Couple brake pedals together for road travel.

Safety

● Pump brakes when stopping on slippery surfaces.

● Regularly clean fenders and fender valances (mud flaps) if installed. Remove dirt before driving on public roadways.

Heated and Ventilated Operator’s Seat

● An overheated seat heater can cause a burn injury or damage to the seat. To reduce the risk of burns, use caution when using the seat heater for extended periods of time, especially if the operator cannot feel temperature change or pain to the skin. Do not place objects on the seat, such as a blanket, cushion, cover, or similar item, which can cause the seat heater to overheat.

Towing Loads

● Be careful when towing and stopping heavy loads. Stopping distance increases with speed and weight of towed loads, and on slopes. Towed loads with or without brakes that are too heavy for the tractor or are towed too fast can cause loss of control.

● Consider the total weight of the equipment and its load.

● Hitch towed loads only to approved couplings to avoid rearward upset.

Parking and Leaving the Tractor

● Before dismounting, shut off SCVs, disengage PTO, stop engine, lower implements/attachments to ground, place implement/attachment control devices in neutral, and securely engage park mechanism, including the park pawl and park brake. In addition, if the tractor is left unattended, remove key.

● Leaving transmission in gear with engine off will NOT prevent the tractor from moving.

● Never go near an operating PTO or an operating implement.

● Wait for all movement to stop before servicing machinery.

Common Accidents

Unsafe operation or misuse of the tractor can result in accidents. Be alert to hazards of tractor operation.

The most common accidents involving tractors are:

● Tractor rollover

● Collisions with motor vehicles

● Improper starting procedures

● Entanglement in PTO shafts

● Falling from tractor

● Crushing and pinching during hitching

Avoid Backover Accidents

Before moving machine, be sure that all persons are clear of machine path. Turn around and look directly for best visibility. Use a signal person when backing if view is obstructed or when in close quarters.

Do not rely on a camera to determine if personnel or obstacles are behind the machine. The system can be limited by many factors including maintenance practices, environmental conditions, and operating range.

Limited Use in Forestry Operation

The intended use of John Deere tractors when used in forestry operations is limited to tractor-specific applications like transport, stationary work such as log splitting, propulsion, or operating implements with PTO, hydraulic, or electrical systems.

These are applications where normal operation does not

Operating the Loader Tractor Safely

When operating a machine with a loader application, reduce speed as required to ensure good tractor and loader stability.

To avoid tractor rollover and damage to front tires and tractor, do not carry load with your loader at a speed over 10 km/h (6 mph).

To avoid tractor damage do not use a front loader or a sprayer tank if the tractor is equipped with a 3 Meter Front Axle.

Never allow anyone to walk or work under a raised loader.

Do not use loader as a work platform.

Do not lift or carry anyone on loader, in bucket, or on implement or attachment.

Use Caution on Slopes, Uneven Terrain, and Rough Ground

Avoid holes, ditches, and obstructions which cause the tractor to tip, especially on slopes. Avoid sharp uphill turns.

Driving forward out of a ditch, mired condition, or up a steep slope could cause the tractor to tip over rearward. Back out of these situations if possible.

Danger of overturn increases greatly with narrow tread setting, at high speed.

Not all conditions that can cause a tractor to overturn are listed. Be alert for any situation in which stability may be compromised.

Slopes are a major factor related to loss-of-control and tip- over accidents, which can result in severe injury or death. Operation on all slopes requires extra caution.

Uneven terrain or rough ground can cause loss-of-control and tip-over accidents, which can result in severe injury or death. Operation on uneven terrain or rough ground requires extra caution.

Never drive near the edge of a gully, drop-off, ditch, steep embankment, or a body of water. The machine could

Freeing a Mired Machine

Attempting to free a mired machine can involve safety hazards such as the mired tractor tipping rearward, the towing tractor overturning, and the tow chain or tow bar (a cable is not recommended) failing and recoiling from its stretched condition.

Back your tractor out if it gets mired down in mud. Unhitch any towed implements. Dig mud from behind the rear wheels. Place boards behind the wheels to provide a solid base and try to back out slowly. If necessary, dig mud from the front of all wheels and drive slowly ahead.

If necessary to tow with another unit, use a tow bar or a long chain (a cable is not recommended). Inspect the chain for flaws. Make sure all parts of towing devices are of adequate size and strong enough to handle the load.

Always hitch to the drawbar of the towing unit. Do not hitch to the front pushbar attachment point. Before moving, clear the area of people. Apply power smoothly to take up the slack: a sudden pull could snap any towing device causing it to whip or recoil dangerously.

Service Accumulator Systems Safely

Escaping fluid or gas from systems with pressurized accumulators that are used in air conditioning, hydraulic, and air brake systems can cause serious injury. Extreme heat can cause the accumulator to burst, and pressurized lines can be accidentally cut. Do not weld or use a torch near a pressurized accumulator or pressurized line.

Relieve pressure from the pressurized system before removing accumulator.

Relieve pressure from the hydraulic system before removing accumulator. Never attempt to relieve hydraulic system or accumulator pressure by loosening a fitting.

Accumulators cannot be repaired.

Service Tires Safely

Explosive separation of a tire and rim parts can cause serious injury or death.

Do not attempt to mount a tire unless you have the proper equipment and experience to perform the job.

Always maintain the correct tire pressure. Do not inflate the tires above the recommended pressure. Never weld or heat a wheel and tire assembly. The heat can cause an increase in air pressure resulting in a tire explosion. Welding can structurally weaken or deform the wheel.

When inflating tires, use a clip-on chuck and extension hose long enough to allow you to stand to one side and NOT in front of or over the tire assembly. Use a safety cage if available.

Check wheels for low pressure, cuts, bubbles, damaged rims, or missing lug bolts and nuts.

Service Front-Wheel Drive Tractor Safely

When servicing front-wheel drive tractor with the rear wheels supported off the ground and rotating wheels by engine power, always support front wheels in a similar manner. Loss of electrical power or transmission hydraulic system pressure will engage the front driving wheels, pulling the rear wheels off the support if front wheels are not raised. Under these conditions, front drive wheels can engage even with switch in disengaged position.

CAUTION: Avoid Injury! Driving at high speeds with the traction assist engaged may result in loss of steering control. Do not engage traction assist or turn with the traction assist engaged while operating machine at high speeds or on slopes.

A

● Reduce speed and allow drive wheels to rotate at same speed before engaging or disengaging traction assist.

● Disengage traction assist when driving on dry asphalt or concrete.

● Use traction assist only when necessary for improved ground engagement.

The differential lock is used to provide better traction when rear wheels start to slip. Engaging differential lock will lock right and left side rear axles together and cause both rear wheels to turn at equal speeds for maximum traction.

1. Remove foot from differential lock pedal.

NOTE: Rear wheel slippage will keep differential lock engaged. Lock will automatically disengage when traction equalizes.

2. If lock does not disengage when removing foot from pedal, depress brake pedal to equalize traction, then release.

Using Mechanical Front Wheel Drive (MFWD)

Mechanical front wheel drive (MFWD) enables the powertrain to drive both front and rear axles for improved traction on difficult ground conditions and provides 4-wheel braking. MFWD can be engaged and disengaged on-the-go with light loads and on low traction surfaces.

CAUTION: Avoid Injury! Use extra caution when driving on slopes. To increase traction and provide four-wheel braking, engage mechanical front wheel drive (MFWD) when driving on slopes. Be aware that MFWD can improve access to dangerously sloped terrain, thereby increasing the possibility of tipover.



NOTE: It may be necessary to reduce engine load to disengage front wheel drive.

Push MFWD lever (A) forward to engage MFWD. Pull lever rearward to disengage MFWD.

Tips for Operating MFWD:

● Maintain front tire pressure at maximum allowable level to ensure proper tire performance in all field conditions.

● Engage MFWD to provide four-wheel braking.

● Disengage MFWD when driving machine to or from work site to increase front tire life.

CAUTION: Avoid injury! Stay clear of rotating drivelines:



● Entanglement in the rotating driveline can cause serious injury or death.

● Keep hands, feet, and clothing away.

● Make sure that all shields are installed and used properly.

● Stop the engine and be sure that PTO driveline is stopped before getting near it.

Check PTO Driveshaft Length

IMPORTANT: Avoid Damage! The PTO driveshaft is a standard length. Certain driveshaft applications cause contact with transmission. Shorten driveshaft length to avoid contact.

Checking PTO Driveshaft

NOTE: Check PTO driveshaft movement before operating implement.

b. Check the area where the outer tube shield (A) meets the shield bell (B).

c. If the outer tube shield does not touch the shield bell, make a mark on the inner tube where the outer tube shield ends.

5. Install driveshaft on tractor and adjust the center link to level the implement for operating while in lowered position. (See Operating 3-Point Hitch.)

6. Have an observer stand a safe distance from the implement to tell you when the driveshaft is fully shortened.

7. Set the tractor at low idle and raise the implement. Stop raising the implement when the outer tube shield reaches the mark on the inner tube, or the outer tube shield touches the shield bell.

● If the implement is fully raised and the driveshaft does not reach the fully shortened position, with either the outer tube shield at the mark or touching the bell shield, the driveshaft is ready for operation.

● If the driveshaft reaches the fully shortened position before the implement is fully raised, the driveshaft requires shortening.

2. Fasten weight to each rear wheel using a safe lifting device. A total of three weights per wheel may be used. See your implement operator’s manual for installation and number of weights to use.

Add weight to machine front end if needed for stability. Heavy pulling and heavy rear mounted implements tend to lift front wheels. Add enough ballast to maintain steering control and prevent tip over. Remove weight when it is no longer needed.

IMPORTANT: Avoid Damage! Remove ballast from machine when no longer needed.

Rear wheel weights are available from your John Deere Dealer.

Using Optional Rear Ballast Box

CAUTION: Avoid Injury! To improve front loader- machine stability, use of ballast box is recommended. Use ballast as recommended in loader operator’s manual.

* Maximum pressure following tire manufacturer’s specifications.

**Maximum load capacity for single tire.

NOTE: Use of alcohol as ballast is not recommended. Calcium chloride solution is heavier and more economical.

A solution of water and calcium chloride provides safe economical ballast, and will prevent freezing. If used properly, it will not damage tires, tubes, or rims.

A mixture of 0.4 kg of calcium chloride per liter of water (3.5 lb/gal), will not freeze solid above -45° C (-50° F).

Using Optional Rear Cast Iron Wheel Weights

1. Mount rear wheels in the wide position for improved stability.

Fill tubeless tires at least to valve stem level (minimum 75% full). Less solution would expose part of rim, possibly causing corrosion.

Tube-type tires may be filled to any level below 90%.

Recommended Engine Coolant

● Is formulated with a quality nitrite-free additive package.

The engine cooling system is filled to provide year-round protection against corrosion and cylinder liner pitting, and winter freeze protection to -37 degrees C (-34 degrees F). If protection at lower temperatures is required, consult your John Deere dealer for recommendations.

● Provides cylinder liner cavitation protection according to either the John Deere Cavitation Test Method or a fleet study run at or above 60% load capacity.

● Protects the cooling system metals (cast iron, aluminum alloys, and copper alloys such as brass) from corrosion.

The following coolants are preferred:

● John Deere COOL-GARD™ II Premix

● John Deere COOL-GARD™ II PG Premix

Use John Deere COOL-GARD II PG Premix when a non- toxic coolant formulation is required.

The following engine coolant is also recommended:

The additive package must be part of one of the following coolant mixtures:

● Ethylene glycol or propylene glycol base prediluted (40 —60%) heavy duty coolant.

● Ethylene glycol or propylene glycol base heavy duty coolant concentrate in a 40—60% mixture of concentrate with quality water.

● John Deere COOL-GARD™ II Concentrate in a 40— 60% mixture of concentrate with quality water.

John Deere COOL-GARD II Premix, COOL-GARD II PG Premix, and COOL-GARD II Concentrate coolants do not require use of supplemental coolant additives.

Water Quality

● Water quality is important to the performance of the cooling system. Distilled, deionized, or demineralized water is recommended for mixing with ethylene glycol and propylene glycol base engine coolant concentrate.

Other Coolants

John Deere COOL-GARD II and COOL-GARD II PG coolants might not be available in the geographical area where service is performed.

IMPORTANT: Avoid damage! Do not use cooling system sealing additives or antifreeze that contains sealing additives.

Do not mix ethylene glycol and propylene glycol base coolants.

If these coolants are unavailable, use a coolant concentrate or pre-diluted coolant intended for use with heavy duty diesel engines and with a minimum of the following chemical and physical properties:

Do not use coolants that contain nitrates.

Consult your local fuel distributor for properties of the diesel fuel in your area.

In general, diesel fuels are blended to satisfy the low temperature requirements of the geographical area in which they are marketed.

Diesel fuels specified to EN 590 or ASTM D975 are recommended.

IMPORTANT: Avoid injury! Do not mix diesel engine oil or any other type of lubricating oil with diesel fuel.

Using Bio-Diesel Fuel

Bio-diesel fuels may be used only if the bio-diesel fuel properties meet the latest edition of ASTM D6751, ASTM D7467, EN14214, or equivalent specification.

The current maximum allowable bio-diesel concentration is a 5% blend (also known as B5) in petroleum diesel fuel.

Concentrations up to B20 may be used if machine is modified with genuine John Deere B20 kit. Use of B6-B20 fuel will require maintenance interval changes from some components, and special procedures for fuel handling and machine storage.

Required fuel properties

In all cases, the fuel shall meet the following properties:

Cetane number of 45 minimum. Cetane number greater than 50 is preferred, especially when temperatures are below -20°C (-4°F) or elevations above 1500 m (5000 ft).

To learn of any changes to the recommendations for bio- diesel usage with your diesel engine, ask your John Deere dealer or reference the Services and Support link on the John Deere Commercial and Consumer Equipment website.

Cold Filter Plugging Point (CFPP) should be at least 5°C (9°F) below the expected lowest temperature or Cloud Point below the lowest ambient temperature.

Handling and Storing Diesel Fuel

CAUTION: Avoid injury! Handle fuel carefully. Do not fill the fuel tank when engine is running.



Fuel lubricity should pass a maximum scar diameter of 0.45 mm as measured by ASTM D6079 or ISO 12156-1.

Do not smoke while you fill the fuel tank or service the fuel system.

IMPORTANT: Avoid damage! Improper fuel additive usage may cause damage on fuel injection equipment of diesel engines.

If a fuel of low or unknown lubricity is used, addition of John Deere PREMIUM DIESEL FUEL CONDITIONER at the specified concentration is recommended.

IMPORTANT: Avoid damage! Do not use galvanized containers—diesel fuel stored in galvanized containers reacts with zinc coating in the container to form zinc flakes. If fuel contains water, a zinc gel will also form. The gel and flakes will quickly plug fuel filters and damage fuel injectors and fuel pumps.

Sulfur content

● Diesel fuel quality and fuel sulfur content must comply with all existing emissions regulations for the area in which the engine operates.

● Use only ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel with a maximum of 0.0015% (15mg/kg) sulfur content.

● Fill the fuel tank at the end of each day’s operation to prevent water condensation and freezing during cold weather.

● When fuel is stored for an extended period or if there is a slow turnover of fuel, add a fuel conditioner to stabilize the fuel and to prevent water condensation. Contact your fuel supplier for recommendations.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and John Deere are pleased to explain the emission control system warranty on your 1995 and later non-road diesel equipment engine. In California, 1995 and later non-road diesel equipment engines must be designed, built and equipped to meet the State’s stringent anti-smog standards. In other states, 1997 and later model year equipment engines must be designed, built and equipped to meet the U.S. EPA regulations for non-road diesel engines. John Deere must warrant the emission control system on your non-road diesel equipment engine for the periods of time listed below provided there has been no abuse, neglect or improper maintenance of your non-road diesel equipment engine.

Your emission control system may include parts such as the fuel-injection system and the air induction system. Also included may be connectors and other emission related assemblies.

As the non-road diesel equipment engine owner, you should however be aware that John Deere may deny you warranty coverage if your non-road diesel equipment engine or a part has failed due to abuse, neglect, improper maintenance or unapproved modifications.

You are responsible for presenting your non-road diesel equipment engine to an authorized John Deere Turf & Utility Retailer as soon as a problem exists. The warranty repairs should be completed in a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days.

If you have any questions regarding your warranty rights and responsibilities, you should contact your John Deere Turf & Utility Retailer, or the John Deere Customer Contact Center, 1-800-537-8233, or e-mail John Deere from www. Deere.com.
